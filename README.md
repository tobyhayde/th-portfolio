# Toby Hayde Portfolio
#
This repository contains HTML and CSS code producing a portfolio linking to multiple applications along with "about me" and "contact" sections. 
#
I used flex-boxes to position most of the content, along with media queries to make sure the website is responsive to mobiles.
#
Here are screenshots of the website deployed on a desktop and on a mobile screen.
